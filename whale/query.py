        Helper function to build the 'geoJson' value payload for spatial filters.
        Only supports polygon geometries currently.

        Builds cloud cover bandpass filter with parameters for min/max coverage and unknown values.
    build_spatial_filter(geojson: dict) -> dict:
        Converts GeoJSON to EarthExplorer spatial filter format. Only supports polygons.
        Expects EPSG:4326 coordinates.
    build_acqusition_filter(start: str, end: str) -> dict:
        Creates temporal filter using ISO 8601 datetime strings.
    build_dataset_filter(acquisition: dict, spatial: dict) -> dict:
        Wrapper to build dataset search API query from acquisition and spatial filters.
    build_scene_filter(acquisition: dict, spatial: dict, cloud: dict) -> dict:
        Wrapper to build scene search API query from acquisition, spatial and cloud filters.
    build_ee_query_payload(start_date: str, end_date: str, aoi: dict) -> str:
        Builds complete Earth Explorer API query payload as JSON string.
    query_mgp(username: str, password: str, collections: list, start: str, end: str, 
              where: str, limit: int, export: str = None, bbox: list = None, geometry: dict = None) -> list:
        Performs spatio-temporal query against Maxar Geospatial Portal STAC API.
        Returns API response and list of catalog IDs matching query parameters.
These functions make use of work found at: https://github.com/yannforget/landsatxplore
