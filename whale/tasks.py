"""
Process ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data for selected records.

This module contains functions for processing ETL data based on filtered IDs.
It fetches the corresponding ExtractTransformLoad model objects and processes
them individually.

Functions:
    process_etl_data(filtered_data_ids): Process multiple ETL records
    process_data(etl): Process a single ETL record

Args:
    filtered_data_ids (list): List of ExtractTransformLoad record IDs to process
    etl (ExtractTransformLoad): Individual ETL model instance to process

Returns:
    str: "Processing Complete" confirmation message

Example:
    >>> ids = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> result = process_etl_data(ids)
    >>> print(result)
    "Processing Complete"
